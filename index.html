		<div class = "ourstory-wrapper">
			<h2>OUR STORY</h2>
			<br>
			<h3>Founded in 2015, SheEO is an organization dedicated to bridging the gender gap in our society. Despite the increase in awareness, the glass ceiling is still very prevalent in our society. With fewer than 10% of CEO's being female, and a salary disparity of 21%, SheEO hopes to inspire today's girls to become tomorrow's leaders. </h3>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h3> SheEO's unique curriculum of combining programming and leadership skills allows SheEO to teach girls that computer science and business are mearly tools to achieve feats of unimaginable bounds. As these skills become increasingly prominent in any field of study, instilling them in girls at a young age allows SheEO to inspire the next wave of social entreprenuers. So far, SheEO has hosted workshops, online events, and an ambassadors program to reach to a national audience all towards the common goal of gender parity.</h3>
