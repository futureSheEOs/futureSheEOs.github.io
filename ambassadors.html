				As an extension of the SheEO brand, college ambassadors help reach out to other colleges, universities, and communities. Our ambassadors will work to cultivate diversity in the fields of entrepreneurship and technology by organizing at least three SheEO events on their campus or in their communities. Some of these events include speaker dinners, technical workshop series, hackathons, career days, discussions, educational outings, community mixers, etc. Applicants must be at least 18 years of age, and must be currently enrolled in a college/university.</p>
